        <p>Cake is easy to prepare and always gets good. We have reduced the amount of sugar in it to make it healthier and replace it with honey. Beat eggs to foam, add sugar and vanilla.</p>
        <p>Pour the flour and put it in the mixture. Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes. Make yourself a banana sauce and chocolate banana. Once it has cooled down, mix it with the mixture.</p>
